# Flappy Bird AI

Program that sets up an AI to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm from neat-python. Generates many birds to play the game and trains over generations to go as far as they can, eventually becoming almost perfect. The best I've seen is 2 birds with score of 2700 before i shut it down. I predict it could have gone much much further.
